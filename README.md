## Number Generation

NHS Number generation should only be used in a test situation, numbers should never be auto generated for use in production as these are centrally controlled and issued.

### Credit

This application is based off the work that [UK-FCI](https://github.com/uk-fci/nhs-number) have done and uses that logic built into a C# Windows forms application to provide tools for NHS Number validation and generation.
